However, they are also referred to as harvesters and rejoicers, playing a crucial role in shaping the meaning and future of humanity. Creators are compared to mothers, enduring pain and willingness to destroy old structures for the emergence of something new. They are differentiated from actors and fabricators as their primary motivation is creation rather than presentation or manipulation. This process of creating often involves evaluating what already exists, thereby giving meaning to their actions. Creators might be seen as complex, hard, and sometimes unclean due to their transformative nature, but they possess the power to create new values and freedom for continuous innovation.\n",
